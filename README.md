# AI_minimaxalgoritm_tictoctoe_game
Using Minimax algorithm, implement an AI to play Tic-Tac-Toe optimally.

There are two main files in this project: runner.py and tictactoe.py. tictactoe.py contains all of the logic for playing the game, and for making optimal moves. runner.py  contains all of the code to run the graphical interface for the game. This part(runner.py) taken from CS50â€™s Introduction to Artificial Intelligence with Python Online Course document.
